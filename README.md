# .files

### What this is
These are my personal configuration files for my environment on the student machine. I'm going to keep them here so I don't lose them when I get out of school. I've got my bash configuration and vim configuration

### Tell me about your vim config! 
I've been building this vim config over the past few years for various projects and different things I've been working on in school. I started building it on @jonjonsonjr's config. The config has at least syntax highlighting for just about every language I've ever written. 

##### Features
- The gotham256 color scheme
- ConqueGDB for debugging applications with GDB
- Built in R support, opens a shell as a buffer. Keys bindings to knit R markdown documents
- fatih/vim-go a neat plugin for writing software in Go. It automatically does gofmt for you
- Built in Clojure repl with nailgun and Clojure highlighting
- Octave in Buffer / syntax highlighting
- Prolog highlighting
- F# highlighting
- Minimal node.js highlighting
